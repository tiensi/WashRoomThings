# WashRoomThings
Android Things App, uses a door switch to determine whether or not a room is in use or not. This was a basic foray into the world of Android Things and Ruby on Rails. [The accompanying Rails project is here](https://bitbucket.org/tiensi/wash_room_status/src/master/).

The purpose of this project was to detect when a room was being used and update both some light sensors and a backend whenever the room status changed.
